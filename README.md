springboard capstone project

Description:
What is the problem you want to solve?

I want to investigate the relationships between climate change and agricultural output and food security.

Who is your client and why do they care about this problem? In other words, what will your client DO or DECIDE based on your analysis that they wouldnâ€™t have otherwise?

My client is (hypothetically) a large food conglomerate like Nestle or General Mills. Food production is closely related to climate change, and using my analysis these clients can make more conscientious business decisions regarding food production and distribution- in particular making sure not to overprice food which would be damaging to for business and have  potentially concerning effects on food security.

What data are you going to use for this? How will you acquire this data?

CCAFS-Climate Data on Amazon Web Services daatsets which can be found at This link: https://aws.amazon.com/datasets/ccafs-climate-data/

In brief, outline your approach to solving this problem (knowing that this might change later).

	1.  Download climate-change data from CCAFS 
	2. Wrangle the data for appropriate factors and time period
	3. Sample the data 
	4. Apply trends to data
	5. Correlate data to trends in food production and security
  
What are your deliverables? Typically, this would include code, along with a paper and/or a slide deck.

	Deliverables:
	Code (pushed onto github repository) + comments + read_me
PDF write-up (research style paper with embedded graphs, captions, and statistics)
Powerpoint summary (potentially)
